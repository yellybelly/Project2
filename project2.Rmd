```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
main = read.csv("top.csv")
main
```

```{r}
summary(main$`RATING`)
```

```{r}
main$VOTES<- as.factor(main$VOTES)
summary(main$`VOTES`)
```
Now, we want to see what rating the majority of the TV shows are. 

```{r}
an <- main %>%
                    filter(main$RATING == 9.5)
an
```

```{r}
and <- main %>%
                    filter(main$RATING == 9.4)
and
```
Here, it is shown that the majority of the TV shows are rated between 9.4 and 9.5.


```{r}
ggplot(main, aes(x= `RATING`)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .05)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = main, aes(x = `RATING`, y =`VOTES`)) + geom_point()
```

Surprisingly, there doesn't seem to be much of a relationship between the rating and the votes on the TV shows. A great example is that there is a show with the most votes, which does not have the highest rating.
